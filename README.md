# Pokedex (for a technical test)

## A React app built to apply for a front-end React developer position at Zipdev

I built this React App to apply for a front-end React developer position. Initially, I didn't think much of it because of the straightforward instructions: to build a visual component for the public Pokemon API. But, soon after, I was instructed that I would only be given two hours to complete the challenge and that's when I started to realize the task's difficulty.

Normally, I tend to code at a fair pace. This means that I allow myself ample time for research and for trial-and-error. As is the case for most React apps that I've built, something always breaks. Be it a small mistake in a `map` method or a the state not setting properly after a GET request, these things add up and take time to fix. So, when given a strict deadline for this project, I quickly realized that I couldn't waste any time. Every minute was precious.

Admittedly, I could not deliver the full product with all of the features requested. I could not fully implement Flow or Typescript annotations because of the sheer amount of extra code that I needed to write. I also obviously left this part for the last half an hour and didn't really accomplish much, because I was still polishing the normal code. Perhaps next time I'll consider writing annotations as I build new components.
